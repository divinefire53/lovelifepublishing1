		<h2>Services</h2>
		
		<p>1. Love Life Publishing offers several services to assist you in your literature journey. The first step after writing your manuscript is proofreading and editing. We have qualified professionals in both areas, and can handle anything from small poems to lengthy novels. We also have specialists who have detailed training in medical and legal writing.</p>
		
		<p>2. After your work is edited, it's time to print. Our state of the art equipment is perfect for any publication.  We can print small newsletters and pamphlets, as well as soft- and hard-bound books. Contact us for an estimate on any job, large or small.<p>
		
		<p>3. Marketing is an important and often overlooked part of the process. Years of experience gives us the upper hand in knowing how to reach your potential audience. We'll work with you to decide your budget, time constraints, and availability, then put together a plan for a perfect book launch.<p>
