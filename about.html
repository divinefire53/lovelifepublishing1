		<p>Love Life Publishing was started by Diana Love in 2023, to provide editing and proofreading services to ecommerce sellers. Diana has always been a bit of a connoisseur of words. She started writing poems and short stories when she was very young, and continues to hone her skills even today. She studied English Literature in high school and college, working for her college newspaper and writing essays. As with any good writer, she currently has 2-3 books "in the works", and looks forward to publishing one day soon.</p>
